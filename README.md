hey everyone! i'm dainfloop. funny developer online (debated).

here's some things i've done to make me slightly notable.

- [Replit](https://github.com/replit) Site Moderator (Dec 2022 - Apr 2024)
  
  i was a site mod for replit. what else can i say?

- i made [DaInfLoop/osu-leaderboard](https://github.com/DaInfLoop/osu-leaderboard)
  
  a cool osu! leaderboard and syncing system for [@hackclub](https://github.com/hackclub)!  
  you should totally join hack club if you're under 18.

  i have no clue what else is notable about me.
